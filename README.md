# **Gene expression QTL mapping in stimulated iPSC-derived macrophages provides insights into common complex diseases**

## **Overview**
This repository contains some data (and links to all the data), scripts, and analysis pipelines used for our study.


## **Abstract**
Many disease-associated variants are thought to be regulatory but are not present in existing eQTL catalogues. We hypothesize that these variants may regulate gene expression in **stimulated immune cells**. Using human iPSC-derived macrophages, we mapped eQTLs across **24 stimulation conditions** and found that:
- 76% of eQTLs detected in at least one stimulated condition were also present in naive cells.
- Response eQTLs (reQTLs) varied across conditions, ranging from **3.7% to 28.4%**.
- reQTLs specific to a single condition were rare (**1.11%**), but significantly overrepresented among disease-colocalizing eQTLs.
- We identified **21.7% additional disease effector genes** through reQTL colocalization, with **38.6% of these not found in the GTEx dataset**.

Our findings underscore the importance of **context-specific regulatory variation** in understanding **common disease risk alleles**.
